# C_Data_Structures
an assortment of data structures for use in C with arbitrary data.
all data structures are implemented iteratively.
this is done by maintaining data structures where the payload is 
always pointed to by a void pointer. 

Current Implementations of:

Stacks,
Queues,
Linked Lists,
Binary Search Trees,
AVL Search Trees,
Vectors,

all data structure implement macros for size (number of nodes), empty and
sometimes peek. 

all data structures implement functions for make, free, traversal, insert,
delete, and search functionality. sometimes a few other utility functions are
also present
